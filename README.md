# Unit 20 Homework: Myopia Clusters

For this assignment, I am on the data science team of a medical research company thatâ€™s interested in finding better ways to predict myopia, or nearsightedness. My team has tried and failed to improve our classification model when training on the whole dataset. However, we believe that there might be distinct groups of patients that would be better to analyze separately. I will be using several clustering algorithms to explore whether the patients can be placed into distinct groups. 

### Findings 
Using t-SNE and K-means, I was able to divide the patients into 5 distinct groups.
